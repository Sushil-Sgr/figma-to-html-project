                    <p>Moving to a new home every few years is an exciting yet stressful part of being in the military.
                        That means that it’s vital for you to
                        understand your PCS entitlements before you head off to your next great adventure. From
                        purchasing packing supplies to
                        protecting your personal goods to paying for a moving company or driving across the country
                        (coffee and fast food can add up,
                        after all), there’s a lot to do and to pay for. That’s why it is so important to stay organized.

                    <p>Since the military requires you to PCS every 1-4 years, they have dedicated programs and
                        financial benefits to help ease you
                        through the process. To help out even more, we’ve compiled information about the latest PCS
                        entitlements, Dislocation Allowance
                        (DLA) Rates, and more that you will need for your upcoming orders</p>

                    <h3>1. Dislocation Allowance</h3>
                    <p>Often abbreviated as DLA, your Dislocation Allowance is a flat sum meant to cover the incidental
                        and extra expenses of moving on
                        PCS orders. You don’t receive this automatically. Instead, you’ll need to be proactive in
                        submitting a claim to your current
                        installation’s travel ofce as part of your PCS process. There’s also an additional benefit
                        called a Secondary DLA, which is for
                        those military members whose PCS orders change after they’ve already relocated.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your 2022 Dislocation Allowance will depend on several factors, including your current rank and
                        if you have any dependents.
                        Military members with dependents usually see anywhere from $700 -$1,000 extra in DLA. Lucky for
                        you, rates for 2022 DLA went
                        up by a decent amount, so if you’re PCSing in 2022, you can expect a little bit extra from the
                        military.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Per Diem</h3>
                    <p>Your next set of PCS entitlements comes in the form of a daily allowance. Any time you travel on
                        government orders, including
                        PCS moves, you’re entitled to <a href="#">per diem pay.</a> Per diem is how the military
                        reimburses you for daily costs associated with a move,
                        like lodging and meals.
                    </p>
                    <p>Whether you’re just moving across the state to the next nearest base or headed off for a few
                        years at an <a href="#">OCONUS station</a> ,you’ll
                        receive a daily allowance for each day you’re on the road (or in the air). So your meals,
                        snacks, and other incidentals while you and
                        your family are on the go will be covered. Check out the Defense Travel Management Ofce’s <a
                            href="#">per diem calculator</a> to see what you
                        can expect during your next PCS.
                    </p>
                    <p>2022 rates didn’t see much of a change over 2021 per diem rates. According to gsa.gov, meal and
                        incidental rates average out to
                        be $59, whereas lodging goes unchanged at $96.

                    <h3>3. Mileage Reimbursement</h3>
                    <p>If you’re driving yourself or your family in your own vehicle during your PCS move, those miles
                        will start to add up almost
                        instantaneously, as will the cost of gas to drive them. Luckily, the DoD will reimburse you for
                        the distance you have to travel on
                        PCS orders. <a href="#">The mileage reimbursement</a>The mileage reimbursement rates offered by
                        the Defense Travel Management Ofce will really help offset the cost of
                        traveling via your own car or truck.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They even offer mileage rates for aircraft, if you happen to be flying a private plane or
                        helicopter to your next station, and
                        motorcycles, if you’re a two-wheel type of service member.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mileage reimbursement is paid out on a per-mile basis. That means that you’ll get a certain
                        amount of money for each mile
                        traveled, which also means you need to keep a close eye on your odometer as you travel. For
                        example, last year, someone on TDY
                        traveling to their station via motorcycle would receive $0.54 per mile, while someone driving
                        for a PCS would receive $0.16 per
                        mile.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        While you do have the option to let the military hire movers to get your things to your next
                        base for your PCS, a lot of people
                        choose to do the work themselves. A Personally Procured Move (PPM), which is also referred to as
                        a <a href="#">Do-It-Yourself or DITY Move</a>,
                        lets you control every aspect of the moving process. And, based on the weight of the household
                        goods you’re transporting, the
                        government will reimburse you for up to 95% of the <a href="#">estimated cost of your move</a> .
                        So if it ends up
                        costing you less, you get to keep
                        that money.

                    <p>
                        A PPM has benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, you don’t have to rely on someone else to safely
                        transport your household goods
                        across the country to your new station. On the other hand, it takes a lot more time, effort, and
                        planning to move your home all by
                        yourself across the country every few years. Your choice will depend on how much effort you’re
                        willing to put in and what you think
                        is the best choice for you and your family.

                                    Don’t get caught with pricey overages for your upcoming PCS move. As of August 2013,
                                    the minimum excess cost is
                                    approximately $100 per hundred pounds over the maximum military weight allowance (or
                                    $1 for every pound you go over).
                                    So make sure what you’re transporting is under your weight allowance.
